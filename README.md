# Scala Type Level Programming 
* Type level programming use the compiler as executable on the other hand other programs should be compiled and runned.
* Scala compiler actually have the power to solve the program quickly.
* It will be having some relationships which the compiler actually takes.
* Trait is basically used to share the interfaces(methods) in scala between classes.
* There should be a type defenition in scala
* Type alias means alternative names.
* Type members represent the types rather than the value.
